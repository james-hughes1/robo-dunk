2. Tests: Unit tests for a testing-led development approach
3. Environment: A cannon shoots a ball at a robot, which can then hit it into the basket
4. Train: Use colab to train a PPO model
5. Experimenting: Track with tensorboard
6. Frontend: Build a frontend with Streamlit
7. Containerise: Using Docker and building a FastAPI backend. Deploy on AWS
